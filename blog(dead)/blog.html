                    Hey! I am an aspiring programmer, web developer, game developer, and musician. I plan to graduate <br>
                    with my bachelor's degree in Computer Science and persue a career in web development, while working <br>
                    on my games independently as a hobby. Furthermore, I can fluently play the Ukulele and am currently <br>
                    learning how to play the guitar.
